Why not see if your Beavers would like to try bouldering or soft archery?<br><br>Why not head to the A-Z of activities for more activity inspiration and guidance on how to run the activities? Make sure that you know and follow the rules and safety guidance for that activity. There are rules which apply to activities led by a member of Scouting, and for activities run by external companies or people. Information and guidance on a range of adventurous activities is available at <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/a-z\">scouts.org.uk/a-z</a>.<br><br>Adventurous activities don&#x2019;t have to be expensive to be exciting. It&#x2019;s often cheaper to run as a Scout-led activity, and there are plenty of activities that can be run in Scouting without a permit. Take a look at these blogs about <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/06/activities-you-can-do-without-a-permit/\">activities you can do without a permit</a> and <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/07/water-activities-you-can-do-without-a-permit/\">water activities you can do without a permit. </a><br><br>For activities that do require a permit, you can use Compass to search for a permit holder, or ask your Assistant County/Area Commissioner for Activities, or County/Area MAPS (Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme), or District Commissioner, who signs off permits.More information about the Adventurous Activity Permit Scheme can be found <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,359,366\">here</a>. <br><br>Make the most of expertise and resources within your Group, and more widely, within your District and County or Area. For example:<br><ul><li>find out what support is available from any local or national Scout Active Support Units</li><li>encourage parents with existing skills to volunteer as skills instructors and gain a permit</li><li>if your Beavers are keen to do water activities, why not contact a local Sea Scout Group or Unit, to see if they can provide some support.</li></ul><p>You may be able to access adventurous activities locally through external providers. Availability of activities will depend on your local area, and other leaders within the District or your Assistant Commissioner for Activities, will have suggestions on good activity providers local to you &#x2013; for example <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/\">Scout Adventure Centres</a>, individual instructors, or commercial suppliers. National Governing Bodies (eg. British Canoeing, Royal Yacht Association, British Fencing) and local activity clubs may also be willing to run free taster sessions.</p><p>When searching for a provider, make sure that the venue and activity is accessible for all young people in your section.For guidance on making reasonable adjustments for young people with additional needs or disabilities, go to <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/diversity\">scouts.org.uk/diversity</a>.<br><br>If you need support, contact get in touch with you Assistant County/Area Commissioner for Activities, or another volunteer who can support. There may also be a Scout Active Support Unit at District or County/Area level who can provide targeted support. <br></p><br><b>Take part in six other outside activities</b><br><br>The examples listed are ideas for outdoor activities which could be done as part of this badge. Any activity which is based on being outside would count for this element.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/pol\">Programmes Online</a> contains lots of activity ideas that you could use, and our partner BEAR Nibbles provide lots of guidance and activity sheets for outside activities, which can be found <a href=\"https://fundraising.scouts.org.uk/bearnibbles\">here</a>. <br><b><br></b><p><b>Go on a ramble or nature walk with a purpose</b></p>Have a fun purpose for this walk eg. a treasure hunt, nature walk or picnic.

Beavers could go away with their own Colony, with another Colony, or as part of a Group, District or County event.<br><br>Training on running residential experiences is available as part of the Adult Training Scheme, and you can ask your Assistant District Commissioner (Beavers) or Assistant County Commissioner (Beavers) for help and advice. You must have a Nights Away Permit to run a residential experience.<br><br>Remember that the flexibility statement applies to all badges. There may be some Beavers who are unable to stay away overnight due to a special need or other circumstances, and you will need to think about how they can be involved in a challenge which is appropriate to them in order to complete this badge &#x2013; for example joining the event during the day but sleeping at home.<br><br>When cooking, baking or decorating watch out for allergies. Make sure that all areas and equipment that are used are clean.<br><br><b>Learn how to tie three simple knots</b><br>This is a chance for Beavers to use their imagination, do something practical, and use some simple knots. They could learn how to tie them using their scarves, sweets, pipe cleaners or string. Suggested knots include an overhand knot, reef knot and shoelace knot.<br><br><b>Accident and emergency</b><br>These requirements are the first steps in learning first aid. You may want to ask a first aid specialist in to run a Colony evening on this theme, or you could incorporate these requirements into other activities (for example a visit to the police or fire station, or when taking part in an outdoor activity).<br><br>The Red cross has a brilliant range of information to help you to teach young people what do in an emergency.<br><br>These requirements are also part of the Emergency Aid Stage 1 activity badge. Beavers who have enjoyed completing these requirements may want to go on to complete that badge.<br><br><b>Take part in an activity using natural things; identify five different types of animal, bird or fish; make something to help animals in the wild</b><br>There are a number of activities that can be used to complete these requirements, for example making bird feeders, bird boxes, insect shelters, bee hotels, bark rubbings or nature pictures. <br><br>Resources are available from The Climate Coalition, as part of their <a href=\"https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/show-the-love/\">Show the Love campaign</a> which focuses on helping to protect the people, places and life we love from climate change.

The Beaver doesn&#x2019;t have to take full responsibility for explaining the game &#x2013; it&#x2019;s likely that a leader or Young Leader will do this! But they should be helping others to play, or being a team leader or similar. This requirement could be done in groups, and older Beavers could take it in turns to teach different games to new Beavers.<br><br><b>Take part in three activities about keeping your body fit and healthy</b><br>Any games or activities about health and fitness can be used to complete this requirement. For example games can involve labelling body parts, identifying foods and trying out different exercises and sports. Your local dentist could be an ideal venue for a trip, or could provide some exciting resources like dye sweets to see if you&#x2019;ve brushed your teeth well. <br></p><p>Useful links from the NHS include:<br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-eatwell-guide/\">The Eatwell Guide <br></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/change4life\" target=\"_blank\">Change4Life</a><br></p><p><br><br><b>Do two creative activities</b><br>Almost any creative activity can be used for this requirement. Some activities are suggested in the badge requirements, and other ideas include making musical instruments to play, using clay, plasticine or salt dough to make a model or festive decoration, or painting a picture.<br><br>It is important to give the Beavers as much freedom as possible when they are getting creative &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a chance to explore their own ideas, not make something from a kit or follow instructions.<br><br><b>Learn a new song and sing it</b><br>You may want to incorporate this activity with an indoor or outdoor campfire. The song should be new to the Beaver, but doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to be new to you (or to all Beavers at the same time!). This should be a fun activity, not homework. Try action songs or call and response as they&#x2019;re enjoyable and easy for Beavers to learn.<br><br><b>Learn and use at least three of these home skills</b><br>Any similar home skills can be used to complete this requirement. This could be an opportunity to invite some parents in for an evening to teach skills which the Beavers can then use at home. Try to make the learning of skills fun activities, for example turn learning their address into a creative activity drawing their own house, or a game where they have to quickly recognise their own details. You could turn folding scarves into a relay or a speed competition.<br><br>It is important to make sure that Beavers are well supervised by a competent adult when learning and using some of these skills. Make sure that safety precautions are followed and understood by Beavers, for example when preparing food or lighting a candle.<br><br><b>Invent a machine and show other Beavers how it works</b><br>The importance of this task is the need to explain how it works &#x2013; this will show that Beavers have invented a proper tool or machine and not just a junk model. Beavers could draw their invention, make it from junk/recycled materials, or demonstrate it in some other way. They don&#x2019;t actually have to make it work, just explain what it will do.<br><br><b>With a team, complete at least two problem solving missions set by your leader</b><br>Problem solving games and simple challenge-based activities can be used here. As well as Programmes Online look at the Beaver Games Book for ideas and examples.<br><br><b>Go somewhere new, and find out five facts about something new</b><br>New places could include museums, parks, activity centres, libraries, nearby villages or towns, local landmarks etc. Beavers may find out facts about something new from their visit, from a visitor to the Colony or through a themed evening of activities. Try not to turn this requirement into homework, or something simply researched on the computer. <br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

Why are they important? What would happen if they weren&#x2019;t there? <br></div><div><br></div><div>You could also look at whether there is anything missing in the community which Beavers think it might be useful to have access to. To complete this, you could play a game of &#x2018;location bingo&#x2019;, with Beavers walking around their local area, hunting for different services..<br></div><div><br></div><div>To meet someone who serves their community, Beavers could visit the workplace of a community member, or invite them to visit the Colony.

Alternatively, you could ask Beavers to talk to a Young Leader about this element. You could ask them about activities they have done recently at Beavers or things they&#x2019;ve done to work towards achieving this award. Did they do their best in the activity? Did they help others? They could also think about the person they&#x2019;ve met who serves the community. How do they help others?<br></div><div><br></div><div>This is not a requirement that can be done during one Colony meeting, but should be demonstrated over a period of time, as appropriate to the individual. For some Beavers, this could be an opportunity to show they can improve a specific aspect of their behaviour, like being kind to other people, for example.<br><br><b>Do at least one activity to help you learn about the natural world around you</b><br>This requirement is an opportunity for Beavers to do something practical and fun, which helps them to explore the physical world around them. Some activities could be started during a Colony meeting and completed at home. For example, Beavers could plant seeds during a meeting, then look after them at home.

This is not a requirement that can be done during one Colony meeting, but should be demonstrated over a period of time appropriate to the individual.<br><br>For some Beavers, this could be an opportunity to show that they can improve a specific aspect of their behaviour, for example being kind to other people.<br><br>This requirement should be discussed with the Beaver, it should not be ticked off without them knowing they have completed it. You could do this through activities or discussions with the Colony about what the promise means and how they keep it, on a one to one basis, or you could ask Beavers to talk to a Young Leader about this element.<br><br><b>Do at least three of these things...</b><br>Other similar activities can be anything related to the environment. They should be practical, fun, and help Beavers to explore the world around them. Some activities could be started on a colony night and completed at home &#x2013; for example planting seeds then looking after them at home.</p><p>The Wildlife Trust have activity sheets for fun indoor or outdoor activities on the theme of nature and wildlife, at <a href=\"http://www.wildlifewatch.org.uk/activity-sheets\">wildlifewatch.org.uk/activity-sheets</a><br></p><p><br><b>Take part in activities about another country</b><br>There is a whole variety of activities that can be linked to life in other countries. The expectation of this requirement is that Beavers take part in around 4 different activities covering different topics, for example: national costume, language, food, currency, climate, musical instruments etc.<br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

They can be to do with any part of your life, for example home, school or Beavers.<br><br>Here are some example challenges to help you think about what you could do. You don&#x2019;t have to pick a challenge from this list, you should choose to do something which is personal to you.<br><br></p><ul><li>Look after a new Beaver for half a term</li><li>Talk about a topic you are interested in with an adult you don&#x2019;t know very well</li><li>Bring your scarf to Beavers every week for a term</li><li>Remember to brush your teeth twice a day for two weeks</li><li>Show good behaviour at Beavers for 3 weeks in a row</li><li>Try something new that you are a bit nervous about</li><li>Go to a District fun day and talk to some other Beavers you don&#x2019;t know</li><li>Try all of the food on Beaver sleepover</li><li>Remember to feed your pet every morning for a week<br></li></ul><p>To complete this award Beavers should discuss possible personal challenges with their Leader or an Explorer Scout Young Leader. It may also be helpful to discuss them with the Beaver&#x2019;s parents or carers.<br><br>The emphasis is on the young person having some ownership of this. One of the challenges should be primarily the Beaver&#x2019;s choice, and one the Leader&#x2019;s choice.<br><br>Challenges should be individual, part of &#x2018;growing up&#x2019; and require some kind of personal commitment. For example a shy Beaver&#x2019;s challenge could be to look after a new Beaver for half a term or to talk about a subject with a leader that they don&#x2019;t know; or a forgetful Beaver&#x2019;s challenge could be to remember to bring their scarf every week for a term or to brush their teeth at least twice a day.<br><br>Beavers should agree their two challenges before they start working on them, and it is recommended that the Personal Challenge Award should be completed towards the end of their time in the section before moving onto Cubs.</p><p>For more tips and ideas, read a Scouting Magazine article about the Personal Challenge Awards <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Getting%20personal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

The ability to cooperate and work in small teams is very important in Scouting, and the Beaver teamwork award is designed to encourage and assist Beavers in developing this skill.</p><p>Young people who have difficulties with communicating or working with others, may need extra support or flexibility to achieve this award. This includes many young people on the autism spectrum. For example, young people may find it more difficult to taking turn, express themselves or understand the concepts involved (eg what it means to be a good friend or team member).<br></p><p>This Challenge Award is a great way to focus on the individual young person and how Scouting can benefit them, and contribute to their personal development. It can build on and apply any learning the young person is doing at school or home, in a supportive and fun environment.</p><p>Below and under each requirement,are some practical tips to help you support all young people to achieve this award. For a young person who has autism or another additional need affecting their communication or social skills, it may also be useful to speak to the parent/carer about any specific work being done at school or home.&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Adjust the size of the team or group to the young person&#x2019;s needs. This could include working in a pair or a group of three.</li><li>Time periods and quantities can also be adjusted if necessary.</li><li>It may be useful to explore the benefits of working in a team with the Colony (eg. more can be done; different people are good at different things and bring different ideas and it&#x2019;s a good way to make friends).Don&#x2019;t assume all young people will automatically know why teamwork is positive or what it looks like.</li></ul><br>Please note that any activity completed can only count towards one requirement of the award. <p><b>Take part in at least four different team games</b><br>Beavers enjoy playing games, and this is an opportunity for you to play a variety of different games with the Colony. Remember, Scouting should be youth shaped, so involve young people in planning activities in the Programme.<br></p><p>For young people who find working with others more difficult, this could involve developing participation in games or activities that they are already familiar with or already being used in the Section.<br></p><p>Remember to think about how you give the instructions or rules for the activity, to ensure the understanding of all young people. For more information related to autism, click <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4468/principle-and-strategies-autism?cat=377,786&amp;moduleID=10\">here</a><a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/autism\"></a>. <br></p><p>The suggested time period for completing this requirement is 6 weeks, but this could be longer if needed. The key is to ensure the games are spread throughout the Programme rather than concentrated over one or two meetings, as this gives the Beavers a chance to develop their team working skills.</p><p><b>Working with other Beaver Scouts, make something or complete a challenge or activity together</b><br>To complete this requirement, Beavers should work in small teams, co-operating and working with each other to achieve a common goal. This could be anything from producing piece of artwork or a junk model, to planting bulbs or completing an experiment.</p><p>To encourage young people to start working together, an activity could be used that can only be completed by each member of the team joining in, and could not be completed independently.<br><br><b>Show your leader that you are a helpful team member</b><br>Helpful team members co-operate with the other members of their team, working together and communicating. <br></p><p>Teams in Beavers could be their Lodge, games team or activity group. The specific examples will vary from Beaver to Beaver, and could come from participation in a number of types of team. <br></p><p>Young people might need support in understanding what it means to be a &#x2018;helpful team member&#x2019;. This could be discussed with the whole Colony. Some young people may need a specific example or role that they can take on. For example, keeping time during an activity or encouraging others by saying &#x2018;well done&#x2019; etc.&#xA0;These could be displayed visually, to be used as prompts, or for young people to choose a role in the team.<br></p><p>In order to meet this requirement, Beavers need to be able to give their leaders examples of how they were helpful over a period of about six weeks.<br></p><b>Take part in at least two Log Chews</b><br><p>Log Chew is an opportunity for Beavers to have their say and shape their Scouting experience. Very often an informal discussion with the Colony, it could involve deciding on a programme activity or game, or where to go on an outing. More information about Log Chews and how to run them can be found<a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4093\"> here</a>.<br><br><b>Be a leader in an activity or captain of a team in a game</b><br></p><p>To complete this requirement, a Beaver could be the captain of a football or relay team, picking their fellow team members. They could also lead an activity group, collecting the resources they need and explaining to the rest of their group what they need to do. It may be more appropriate for some Beavers to be responsible for an element of something, rather than leading a whole team. The Leader can be a great role model and demonstrate the role that the young person should take. </p><p>Remember, Scouting should be youth shaped. Ask the young people what activity/game they would like to lead. You could suggest an activity/game that is specific to their interests/skills, or an activity/game they are very familiar/confident with. </p><p><br><b>Demonstrate that you are a good friend</b><br>Activities available on Programmes Online can be used to help Beavers develop friendships within the Colony, and understand what it means to be a good friend. <br></p><p>Young people might need specific examples of how they can be a &#x2018;good friend&#x2019; (for example, sharing things, asking &#x201C;do you need some help?&#x201D;, saying nice things about the other person). This could be discussed as a Colony.This could be part of a structured activity in the Colony&#x2013; eg. saying or writing something nice about each other, or what another person has done to help you.<br></p><p>If a Beaver has difficulty sharing or taking turns, using a timer or agreeing set times may be useful. <br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

It benefits the wider community as well as the young people taking part. Encourage Scouts to go for this badge and help them consider these questions:<br></p><ol><li>Do you want to take action on issues affecting people in your local area, across the country or all across the world?</li><li>Is the action you want to take relevant to the community you&#x2019;re trying to help? Or is it trying to fix a problem that doesn&#x2019;t exist?</li><li>Will it genuinely change the lives of others, or is it just a nice thing to do?</li><li>Will the action you want to take genuinely develop you as a person? Or is it actually quite boring, mundane and not very much fun?</li></ol><p><br><b>Identifying need</b><br><br>Social issues can affect different people in different ways. Young people will face different problems from older people. Those living in the countryside will have different challenges from those who live in a city centre. Social issues in Scotland are very different from those in Tibet. This requirementis about knowing what issues are relevant to the people you are trying to help. Young people should ask themselves:<br></p><ol><li>Who in our chosen community will be an expert in the issues and challenges people face or are passionate about?</li><li>Are there other sources of research or information we can use to identify issues?</li><li>What issues do we care about?</li></ol><p><br><b>Planning action</b><br><br>Community impact is about creating positive social change, so Scouts must be clear on what exactly they want to change before deciding on what practical action to take. You should help young people to ask themselves, in this order:<br></p><ol><li>What is the problem they are trying to fix?</li><li>What needs to change to fix that problem?</li><li>What can we actually do to make that change?</li></ol><p><br><b>Learning and continuing to make change</b><br>&#xA0;<br>Community impact should develop the young person taking part, so your projects should have some kind of learning outcome. Young people should be given space to reflect and talk about what they have learned.<br></p><ol><li>What have they learned about the issue they took action on?</li><li>What skills have they learned?</li><li>How have their values and attitudes developed? </li></ol><p><br>The project should also contribute to social change, and that is unlikely to happen in a short space of time. So once they reach a stage where they consider their project finished, you should support young people to think further.<br></p><ol><li>How could they improve their Community Impact project so that it reaches more people and makes a bigger impact?</li><li>How could they involve more people in their project?</li><li>Would they consider participating in a community impact project run by another organisation or group on the same or different issues?</li></ol><p><br><b>Celebrating the work and inspiring others</b><br><br>Social change happens when others are inspired to take action. You should support young people to reach and inspire more people who can take action on their chosen issue. You could do this through:<br></p><ul><li>interacting with local media</li><li>presenting to relevant groups of people such as local business, decision makers and other community groups</li><li>interacting with other non-Scouting youth groups, such as schools, youth clubs and sports teams</li><li>speaking to their own families, other Scout groups and sections.</li></ul><p></p>Click <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/CI%20Activities%20list.pdf\">here</a> for some ideas to help you achieve this badge.<h4><br></h4><h4>Further support<br></h4><div>Find activities, resources and support to enable young people to take action on the topics of disability; mental wellbeing and resilience; dementia; or clean water and sanitation, at <a href=\"https://www.scouts.org.uk/community\" target=\"_blank\">scouts.org.uk/community</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Read this article from Scouting Magazine on <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/documents/How to plan a community impact project.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">how to run a community impact project</a>.<br></div><div><br></div></div><div>Here are some activities from Scouting Magazine, which you can use to explore particular issues with young people:<br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017%20-%20brain%20connections.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Brain connections</a> (dementia)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-2%20-%20getting%20from%20A%20to%20B.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Getting from A to B</a> (sight loss)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-3%20-%20stressball.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stress ball</a> (mental health)</li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-4%20-%20tinfoil%20still.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tinfoil still</a> (access to clean water)<br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Take a look at these examples of how local Groups have taken part in A Million Hands. <br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/january-project-month\" target=\"_blank\">81st Belfast Beavers -creating memory books</a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2018/07/memory-lane/\">6th East Kilbride Beavers - creating memory boxes</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/project-month-november\" target=\"_blank\">1st Staindrop Cubs - taking action around visual impairment<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-5th-douglas-scouts-hike-for-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">5th Douglas Scouts - completing a water hike<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-1st-knighton-scouts-learn-new-sign-language-for-their-a-million-hands-project/\" target=\"_blank\">1st Knighton Scouts - learning Makaton<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-celebrate-guide-dogs-week-with-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">37th Ormskirk (St Annes) Scout Group - learning about sight loss</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>The Refugee Response Resource provides information, guidance and activities to help Leaders explore the topic of refugees with their section, developing their understanding and supporting them to plan action.Download the resource <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=52,207\">here</a>.</div><br><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

There may also be a County Team or Scout Active Support Unit that can provide support. <br></p><p>Each young person who participates in the Programme, including badges and awards, should face a similar degree of challenge, and requirements can be adapted according to each young person&#x2019;s abilities.For more information and practical tips see our guidance on <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/1301/policy-and-approach?cat=377,293&amp;moduleID=10\">flexibility</a>.</p><p>As with all of the Staged Activity Badges, the stages are progressive to allow young people an ongoing challenge. Although the requirements for Stage 1 can completed without actually being on the water, it&#x2019;s best to complete them as part of a sailing activity. As well as being more fun, this will give young people a head start when they start working towards Stage 2.<br><br>For centres that run sailing, we have a useful list of <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545,553\">water facilities and training centres</a> to refer to. Some <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/\">Scout Adventures</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scouts-scotland.org.uk/activity-centres.aspx\">Scout Scotland National Activity Centres</a> also run this activity.<br></p><p>If running this activity yourself on <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/factsheets/FS120623.pdf\">class C waters</a>, you don&#x2019;t need a permit for sailing, just someone who has the appropriate skills and knowledge to lead the activity, and to complete a risk assessment.Class C waters are &#x2018;safe inland waters which are less than 100m wide where flow causes little effect (including swimming pools)&#x2019;. If on other waters, you can find a local permit holder for this activity, via a permit holder search on Compass (for guidance click <a href=\"https://compasssupport.scouts.org.uk/?guide-cat=permits\">here</a>) or by contacting your local Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme.Take a look at this <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545\">directory</a> which shows classifications of waterways in UK. <br></p><p>If you have a local <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=7,306,308\">Sea Scout</a> Group or Unit , why not see if you can join in with some of their activities, or even arrange a time for their permit holder(s) to take your section out on the water.&#xA0;<br></p><p>By the time young people reach Stage 4, taking part in a sail training experience may be really beneficial in working towards some of the elements of the badge. There are some great opportunities for Explorers to really challenge themselves that are offered by organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.dsp.uk.com/\">Discovery Sailing Project</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adventuresoffshore.co.uk/\">Adventures Offshore</a> are perfect for Explorers to get involved with. <b><br></b></p><p><br><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

County or District Fun Days or competitions, and camps or residential experiences provide a good opportunity to work towards this Award, with the Pack being together for a longer period of time.Alternatively, for a special experience, you can book for your section to complete this award at some Scout Adventures centres. For information, prices and to book, click <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/badges \" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br><br>Guidance on each of the requirements can be found below.<br>&#xA0;<br><p><b>Take part in two different adventurous activities</b><br></p><p>When planning your Programme, make sure that the adventurous activities which you offer are appropriate to the abilities and interests of the Cubs in your Pack.Get your section involved in choosing which activities they want to do, for example by asking for suggestions or taking a vote.<br></p><p></p><p>Why not head to the A-Z of activities for more activity inspiration and guidance on how to run the activities? Make sure that you know and follow the rules and safety guidance for that activity. There are rules which apply to activities led by a member of Scouting, and for activities run by external companies or people. Information and guidance on a range of adventurous activities is available at <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/a-z\">scouts.org.uk/a-z</a>. <br></p><p>Adventurous activities don&#x2019;t have to be expensive to be exciting. It&#x2019;s often cheaper to run as a Scout-led activity, and there are plenty of activities that can be run in Scouting without a permit. Take a look at these blogs about <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/06/activities-you-can-do-without-a-permit/ \">activities you can do without a permit</a> and <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/07/water-activities-you-can-do-without-a-permit/\">water activities you can do without a permit</a>. <br></p><p> For activities that do require a permit, you can use Compass to search for a permit holder, or ask your Assistant County/Area Commissioner for Activities, or County/Area MAPS (Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme), or District Commissioner, who signs off permits.More information about the Adventurous Activity Permit Scheme can be found <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,359,366\">here</a>. <br></p><p>Make the most of expertise and resources within your Group, and more widely, within your District and County or Area. For example:<br></p><ul><li>find out what support is available from any local or national Scout Active Support Units</li><li>encourage parents with existing skills to volunteer as skills instructors and gain a permit</li><li>if your Cubs are keen to do water activities, why not contact a local Sea Scout Group or Unit, to see if they can provide some support. </li></ul><p>&#xA0;<br>You may be able to access adventurous activities locally through external providers. Availability of activities will depend on your local area, and other leaders within the District or your Assistant Commissioner for Activities, will have suggestions on good activity providers local to you &#x2013; for example <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/\">Scout Adventures Centres</a>, individual instructors, or commercial suppliers. National Governing Bodies (eg. British Canoeing, Royal Yacht Association, British Fencing) and local activity clubs may also be willing to run free taster sessions.</p><p>When searching for a provider, make sure that the venue and activity is accessible for all young people in your section.For guidance on making reasonable adjustments for young people with additional needs or disabilities, go to <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/diversity\">scouts.org.uk/diversity</a>.<br><br>If you need support, contact get in touch with you Assistant County/Area Commissioner for Activities, or another volunteer who can support. There may also be a Scout Active Support Unit at District or County/Area level who can provide targeted support. <br><br></p><p><b>Take part in six other outside activities</b></p><p>The examples listed are ideas for outdoor activities which could be done as part of this badge. Any activity which is based on being outside would count for this element, and <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/pol\">Programmes Online</a> contains lots of activity ideas that you could use.<br></p><p><br><b>Go on a hike or follow a trail</b><br></p><p>A walk of around one-two hours would be appropriate for this requirement. The word &#x2018;hike&#x2019; is used to capture Cubs&#x2019; interest and excitement, but remember that what they call a &#x2018;hike&#x2019; you may call a &#x2018;walk&#x2019; &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t have to be difficult or particularly long. <br></p><p>If doing a longer hike, Cubs could work towards their Hikes Away Staged Activity Badge at the same time. Find out about support available from our partner GO Outdoors <a href=\"https://fundraising.scouts.org.uk/gooutdoors\">here</a>. <br></p><p>Make the most out of the activity by getting Cubs involved with using maps or compasses, orienteering, navigating using landmarks or using taped or written instructions. The <a href=\"https://haynes.com/en-gb/outdoor-adventure-manual\">Haynes Outdoor Adventure Manual</a> is great for teaching young people about navigation and make sure you also take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/resources-for-scouts\">resources on the Scout Adventures website</a> for additional advice and support on hiking and navigation with your young people.</p><p>There are plenty of great hiking routes available where you can go hiking without a permit; take a look at our <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/por9.28\">Terrain Zero</a> rule for guidance on where you can walk. If you fancy heading somewhere a bit more challenging with your Pack, you&#x2019;ll need a hillwalking permit which will make sure you have the right skills to take your Pack hiking in the more adventurous environments of <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/por9.29\">Terrain One</a> or <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/por9.30\">Terrain Two</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,407,351\">A-Z of activities</a> is where you can find lots of guidance for planning and running hillwalking activities and for all you need to know about how to gain an Adventurous Activity Permit, check out our <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=419,359,366\">Permit Scheme</a>. <span></span><br></p><p><b>Prepare for your activities and hikes</b></p><p>This requirement is designed to encourage Cubs to start taking responsibility for their own belongings, as well as to introduce what kind of clothing and equipment is suitable for outdoor activities. The key to completion of this requirement is that the Cub knows what they have with them, and has remembered to bring anything particular needed, rather than their parent or carer having done it for them.<br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

Some examples include cooking and comparing healthy and unhealthy foods, seeing how heart rate and breathing are affected by exercise (including games), inviting visitors to the pack (eg. doctors, dentists, local sportspeople), making collages of organs and parts of the body, creating a human skeleton from cut out pieces, or keeping a sleep diary.<br><br><b>Pick two creative things to try, and show your leader what you&#x2019;ve done</b><br>Some examples of creative activities are given in the badge requirements, and others could include writing a poem, using paint, crayons or collage to create a picture, making a model or creative toy, making a short video or decorating cakes in an artistic way. Cubs should be encouraged to think creatively and follow their own thoughts and ideas &#x2013; as such an activity which is about following instructions, making something from a kit or copying others without scope for their own creativity would not count.<br><br><b>Learn and use at least four home skills</b><br>The skills listed are all skills used in everyday life around the home, and anything of a similar level of difficulty could also be used. Make sure that Cubs are appropriately supervised by an adult when doing these things, and that care is taken when providing food and detergents as some children may have allergies. These skills could be undertaken whilst on a normal meeting night or on camp, or could be completed at home and pictures brought in.<br><br><b>Take part in at least two problem-solving activities that you haven&#x2019;t done before that require creative thinking</b><br>Example activities include building a small bridge across a stream, making a timer out of unusual materials, for example to time boiling an egg, designing and making a model with at least 2 moving parts, making a model raft which can float with a lit candle on it, making and solving a code.<br><br>The Cub&#x2019;s explanation of what they found difficult, what they did to solve the problem, and why, doesn&#x2019;t need to be a formal discussion. You could do this by talking with Cubs whilst they&#x2019;re doing the activity, and covering these points informally. The whole group solving the problem could discuss this together.<br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

You don&#x2019;t have to pick a challenge from this list, you should choose to do something which is personal to you.<br></p><ul><li>Look after a new Cub for half a term</li><li>Talk about a topic you are interested in with an adult you don&#x2019;t know very well</li><li>Bring the right equipment to Cubs every week for a term</li><li>Remember to brush your teeth twice a day for two weeks</li><li>Show good behaviour at Cubs for three weeks in a row</li><li>Try something new that you are a bit nervous about</li><li>Go to a District fun day and talk to some other Cubs you don&#x2019;t know</li><li>Try all of the food on Cub camp</li><li>Remember to feed your pet every morning for a week</li><li>Help to look after a sick or disabled friend or relative</li></ul><p><br>To complete this award Cubs should discuss possible personal challenges with their Leader or a Young Leader. It may also be helpful to discuss them with the Cub&#x2019;s parents.<br><br>The emphasis is on the young person having some ownership of this. One of the challenges should be primarily the Cub&#x2019;s choice, and one the Leader&#x2019;s Choice.<br><br>Challenges should be individual, part of &#x2018;growing up&#x2019; and require some kind of personal commitment. For example a shy Cub&#x2019;s challenge could be to look after a new Cub for half a term or to talk about a subject with a leader that they don&#x2019;t know; or a forgetful Cub&#x2019;s challenge could be to remember to bring the right equipment for activities every week for a term or to brush their teeth at least twice a day.<br><br>Cubs should agree their two challenges before they start working on them, and it is recommended that the Personal Challenge Award should be completed towards the end of their time in the section before moving onto Scouts.</p><p>We have adapted a great programme put together by 2nd Southampton Scout Troop to help deliver this Challenge Award to Cubs. The programme and its resources can be found <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Personal%20Challenge%20Evening%20(Cubs).pdf\">here</a>.</p><p>For more tips and ideas, read a Scouting Magazine article about the Personal Challenge Awards <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/documents/Getting personal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

This includes many young people on the autism spectrum.For example, young people may find it more difficult to express themselves, understand others&#x2019; feelings or needs, or understand the concepts involved (eg what it means to be a good leader). <br><br>Scouting provides a great opportunity for young people to learn and develop, in ways they may not necessarily do elsewhere. The Cub Scout leader can be a great role model and source of information, in helping young people to develop their skills in working with others. <br><br>This Challenge Award is a great way to focus on the individual young person and how Scouting can benefit them, and contribute to their personal development. It can build on and apply any learning the young person is doing at school or home, in a supportive and fun environment. <br><br>Below and under each requirement , are some practical tips to help you support all young people to achieve this award. For a young person who has autism or another additional need affecting their communication or social skills, it may also be useful to speak to the parent/carer about any specific work being done at school or home.&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Adjust the size of the team or group to the young person&#x2019;s needs. This could include working in a pair or a group of three.<br></li><li>Time periods and quantities can also be adjusted if necessary.<br></li><li>The Cub Scout Leader can be used as an important role model to demonstrate how to be an effective leader. <br></li></ul><p>Please note that any activity completed can only count towards one requirement of the award.<br><br><b>Lead your Six in an activity or captain a team</b><br>A Cub doesn&#x2019;t have to be a Sixer to meet this requirement- members of the Six could take it in turns to lead their team, for example during a treasure hunt or while completing an activity. They could also lead their tent group in setting up camp, or take charge of their team during a competition.</p><p>Remember, Scouting should be youth shaped. Ask the young person what activity/game they would like to lead. You could suggest an activity/game that is specific to their interests/skills, or an activity/game they are very familiar with. <br></p><p>Young people might need specific examples of how they can be a good leader. This could be discussed as a Pack. For example, making sure the Six/team has what they need for the activity/game, checking everyone understands the instructions and providing instruction (which could be through speech, writing or pictures/photos). <br><br><b>Help a new Cub to join in with the Pack meeting</b><br>If you have a number of Cubs working on this requirement, then two or three older Cubs could work together to look after a new Cub, or they could each take responsibility for different things, for example joining in with grand howl, making sure they get a drink at snack time, including them in games. <br></p><p>It may be helpful to have specific examples or tasks for a young person to choose from and be responsible for.<br><br><b>Teach another Cub a new skill</b><br>To complete this requirement, Cubs should teach a new skill to another member of their pack. This could be a Scouting skill, such as tracking or how to tie a knot, or one of their personal hobbies or interests.</p><p>Young people may need ideas of how to teach another young person a skill. Adult volunteer&#x2019;s will be a good role models for this. This could be through a range of methods, including speaking writing, demonstration, drawing or photos.&#xA0;<br><br><b>Ask your Six or team what they want to do in Cubs, tell your leaders and help to make sure that it happens</b><br>Representing their peers is an important skill for Cubs to learn, not just for Sixers but for all members of the Pack. The activities suggested could all be used to help the Cubs completing the award find out what the rest of the Cubs want to do, whether this is ideas for games and activities to do at weekly meetings, or ideas for their future camp or residential experience.</p><p>If the young person has difficulty with speaking/listening, this could involve a questionnaire, or collecting written feedback from the other Cubs. <br><br>You should then make sure that there are opportunities for the Cubs to feed the information they gather back to the leadership team, for example at a Pack Leadership Forum meeting. You can find guidance on Cub Scout forums <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4094\">here</a>. <br><br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

The key is to ensure that the games are spread throughout the programme rather than concentrated over one or two meetings, as this gives Cubs the chance to develop their team working skills.<br><br><b>Show your leaders what you did to help your team, and how you were a good team player</b><br>A helpful team member is one who co-operates with the other members of the team, working together and communicating.&#xA0;</p><p>Young people might need support in understanding what it means to be a &#x2018;good team player (Cubs). This could be discussed with the whole Pack.<br></p><p>Teams in Cubs could be their Six, games team, residential room/tent group or activity grouping. <br></p><p>Some young people may need a specific example or role that they can take on. For example, keeping time during an activity or encouraging others by saying &#x2018;well done&#x2019; etc.&#xA0;These could be displayed visually, to be used as prompts, or for young people to choose a role in the team. <br></p><p>Working with others to achieve a goal is quite a new concept at this stage in a child&#x2019;s development, and to meet this requirement Cubs should be able to provide a number of examples of how they have helped their team over a period of time.</p><p><br><b>Give examples of two different types of teams, and roles in those teams</b><br>There are many different types of teams that Cubs will participate in, for example Sixes, games teams, sports teams, activity groups and residential experience rooms/tent groups. <br></p><p>To fulfil this requirement, Cubs should give examples of two different types of team and roles in those teams. They may be teams the Cub knows about, or has been part of. For example, they could be the goal keeper of a football team, and the tidiness monitor for their tent group.</p><p>Some young people may have difficulty expressing themselves verbally or remembering this information. Consider others ways they could communicate this information &#x2013; for example, using photographs of them participating in teams, young people could explain either in words or writing, what they were doing.<br><br><b>Complete at least two teambuilding activities with other Cubs</b><br>Teambuilding activities are an integral part of the Cub programme and there should be plenty of opportunities in the programme for Cubs to complete this requirement. Good examples can be found in Programmes Online.</p><p>Some young people may need a specific example or role that they can take on.

It benefits the wider community as well as the young people taking part. Encourage Scouts to go for this badge and help them consider these questions:<br></p><ol><li>Do you want to take action on issues affecting people in your local area, across the country or all across the world?</li><li>Is the action you want to take relevant to the community you&#x2019;re trying to help? Or is it trying to fix a problem that doesn&#x2019;t exist?</li><li>Will it genuinely change the lives of others, or is it just a nice thing to do?</li><li>Will the action you want to take genuinely develop you as a person? Or is it actually quite boring, mundane and not very much fun?</li></ol><p><br><b>Identifying need</b><br><br>Social issues can affect different people in different ways. Young people will face different problems from older people. Those living in the countryside will have different challenges from those who live in a city centre. Social issues in Scotland are very different from those in Tibet. This requirementis about knowing what issues are relevant to the people you are trying to help. Young people should ask themselves:<br></p><ol><li>Who in our chosen community will be an expert in the issues and challenges people face or are passionate about?</li><li>Are there other sources of research or information we can use to identify issues?</li><li>What issues do we care about?</li></ol><p><br><b>Planning action</b><br><br>Community impact is about creating positive social change, so Scouts must be clear on what exactly they want to change before deciding on what practical action to take. You should help young people to ask themselves, in this order:<br></p><ol><li>What is the problem they are trying to fix?</li><li>What needs to change to fix that problem?</li><li>What can we actually do to make that change?</li></ol><p><br><b>Learning and continuing to make change</b><br>&#xA0;<br>Community impact should develop the young person taking part, so your projects should have some kind of learning outcome. Young people should be given space to reflect and talk about what they have learned.<br></p><ol><li>What have they learned about the issue they took action on?</li><li>What skills have they learned?</li><li>How have their values and attitudes developed? </li></ol><p><br>The project should also contribute to social change, and that is unlikely to happen in a short space of time. So once they reach a stage where they consider their project finished, you should support young people to think further.<br></p><ol><li>How could they improve their Community Impact project so that it reaches more people and makes a bigger impact?</li><li>How could they involve more people in their project?</li><li>Would they consider participating in a community impact project run by another organisation or group on the same or different issues?</li></ol><p><br><b>Celebrating the work and inspiring others</b><br><br>Social change happens when others are inspired to take action. You should support young people to reach and inspire more people who can take action on their chosen issue. You could do this through:<br></p><ul><li>interacting with local media</li><li>presenting to relevant groups of people such as local business, decision makers and other community groups</li><li>interacting with other non-Scouting youth groups, such as schools, youth clubs and sports teams</li><li>speaking to their own families, other Scout groups and sections.</li></ul><p></p>Click <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/CI%20Activities%20list.pdf\">here</a> for some ideas to help you achieve this badge.<h4><br></h4><h4>Further support<br></h4><div>Find activities, resources and support to enable young people to take action on the topics of disability; mental wellbeing and resilience; dementia; or clean water and sanitation, at <a href=\"https://www.scouts.org.uk/community\" target=\"_blank\">scouts.org.uk/community</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Read this article from Scouting Magazine on <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/documents/How to plan a community impact project.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">how to run a community impact project</a>.<br></div><div><br></div></div><div>Here are some activities from Scouting Magazine, which you can use to explore particular issues with young people:<br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017%20-%20brain%20connections.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Brain connections</a> (dementia)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-2%20-%20getting%20from%20A%20to%20B.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Getting from A to B</a> (sight loss)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-3%20-%20stressball.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stress ball</a> (mental health)</li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-4%20-%20tinfoil%20still.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tinfoil still</a> (access to clean water)<br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Take a look at these examples of how local Groups have taken part in A Million Hands. <br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/january-project-month\" target=\"_blank\">81st Belfast Beavers -creating memory books</a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2018/07/memory-lane/\">6th East Kilbride Beavers - creating memory boxes</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/project-month-november\" target=\"_blank\">1st Staindrop Cubs - taking action around visual impairment<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-5th-douglas-scouts-hike-for-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">5th Douglas Scouts - completing a water hike<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-1st-knighton-scouts-learn-new-sign-language-for-their-a-million-hands-project/\" target=\"_blank\">1st Knighton Scouts - learning Makaton<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-celebrate-guide-dogs-week-with-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">37th Ormskirk (St Annes) Scout Group - learning about sight loss</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>The Refugee Response Resource provides information, guidance and activities to help Leaders explore the topic of refugees with their section, developing their understanding and supporting them to plan action.Download the resource <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=52,207\">here</a>.</div><br><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

There may also be a County Team or Scout Active Support Unit that can provide support. <br></p><p>Each young person who participates in the Programme, including badges and awards, should face a similar degree of challenge, and requirements can be adapted according to each young person&#x2019;s abilities.For more information and practical tips see our guidance on <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/1301/policy-and-approach?cat=377,293&amp;moduleID=10\">flexibility</a>.</p><p>As with all of the Staged Activity Badges, the stages are progressive to allow young people an ongoing challenge. Although the requirements for Stage 1 can completed without actually being on the water, it&#x2019;s best to complete them as part of a sailing activity. As well as being more fun, this will give young people a head start when they start working towards Stage 2.<br><br>For centres that run sailing, we have a useful list of <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545,553\">water facilities and training centres</a> to refer to. Some <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/\">Scout Adventures</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scouts-scotland.org.uk/activity-centres.aspx\">Scout Scotland National Activity Centres</a> also run this activity.<br></p><p>If running this activity yourself on <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/factsheets/FS120623.pdf\">class C waters</a>, you don&#x2019;t need a permit for sailing, just someone who has the appropriate skills and knowledge to lead the activity, and to complete a risk assessment.Class C waters are &#x2018;safe inland waters which are less than 100m wide where flow causes little effect (including swimming pools)&#x2019;. If on other waters, you can find a local permit holder for this activity, via a permit holder search on Compass (for guidance click <a href=\"https://compasssupport.scouts.org.uk/?guide-cat=permits\">here</a>) or by contacting your local Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme.Take a look at this <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545\">directory</a> which shows classifications of waterways in UK. <br></p><p>If you have a local <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=7,306,308\">Sea Scout</a> Group or Unit , why not see if you can join in with some of their activities, or even arrange a time for their permit holder(s) to take your section out on the water.&#xA0;<br></p><p>By the time young people reach Stage 4, taking part in a sail training experience may be really beneficial in working towards some of the elements of the badge. There are some great opportunities for Explorers to really challenge themselves that are offered by organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.dsp.uk.com/\">Discovery Sailing Project</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adventuresoffshore.co.uk/\">Adventures Offshore</a> are perfect for Explorers to get involved with. <b><br></b></p><p><br><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

Your Troop could tie this in with their <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4403/expedition-challenge-award/?cat=7,64,781&amp;moduleID=10\">Expedition Challenge Award</a>, by planning an expedition to an activity centre or other location, to complete an activity.</p><p>For inspiration, read the blog on the Adventure Challenge Awards <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/07/badge-support-adventure-challenge-awards/\">here</a>. <br></p><p>Guidance on each of the requirements can be found below. <br></p><p><b>Take part in four different adventurous activities preferably on at least two separate occasions.</b></p><p>When planning your Programme, make sure that the adventurous activities which you offer are appropriate to the abilities and interests of the Scouts in your Troop. The activities should, by definition, be adventurous by nature and could be undertaken on land, water or air.Some examples are given in the badge requirements, but these can be added to. <br></p><p>Get your section involved in choosing which activities they want to do, for example by asking for suggestions or taking a vote, or getting Patrol Leaders involved in planning a camp or activity day. For an alternative to traditional canoeing, why not try cardboard canoeing with your Scouts or for more traditional option, why not try orienteering.</p><p>Why not head to the A-Z of activities for more activity inspiration and guidance on how to run the activities? Make sure that you know and follow the rules and safety guidance for that activity. There are rules which apply to activities led by a member of Scouting, and for activities run by external companies or people. Information and guidance on a range of adventurous activities is available at <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/a-z\">scouts.org.uk/a-z</a>. <br></p><p>Adventurous activities don&#x2019;t have to be expensive to be exciting. It&#x2019;s often cheaper to run as a Scout-led activity, and there are plenty of activities that can be run in Scouting without a permit. Take a look at these blogs about <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/06/activities-you-can-do-without-a-permit/\">activities you can do without a permit</a> and <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/07/water-activities-you-can-do-without-a-permit/ \">water activities you can do without a permit. </a><br></p><p> For activities that do require a permit, you can use Compass to search for a permit holder, or ask your Assistant County/Area Commissioner for Activities, or County/Area MAPS (Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme), or District Commissioner, who signs off permits.More information about the Adventurous Activity Permit Scheme can be found <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,359,366\">here</a>. <br></p><p>Make the most of expertise and resources within your Group, and more widely, within your District and County or Area. For example:<br></p><ul><li>find out what support is available from any local or national Scout Active Support Units</li><li>encourage parents with existing skills to volunteer as skills instructors and gain a permit</li><li>if one of the Scouts is skilled in a particular activity, they could work towards gaining a leadership permits, to lead the activity for their peers. </li><li>if your Scouts are keen to do water activities, why not contact a local Sea Scout Group or Unit, to see if they can provide some support. </li></ul><p><br>You may be able to access adventurous activities locally through external providers. Availability of activities will depend on your local area, and other leaders within the District or your Assistant Commissioner for Activities, will have suggestions on good activity providers local to you &#x2013; for example <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/\">Scout Adventures Centres,</a> individual instructors, or commercial suppliers. National Governing Bodies (eg. British Canoeing, Royal Yacht Association, British Fencing) and local activity clubs may also be willing to run free taster sessions.</p><p>When searching for a provider, make sure that the venue and activity is accessible for all young people in your section.For guidance on making reasonable adjustments for young people with additional needs or disabilities, go to <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/diversity\">scouts.org.uk/diversity</a>.<br><br>If you need support, contact get in touch with you Assistant County/Area Commissioner for Activities, or another volunteer who can support. There may also be a Scout Active Support Unit at District or County/Area level who can provide targeted support. <br><br></p><p><b>Show how you have developed your skill and expertise in one of these activities, that you know the safety issues involved, and are able to use safely any equipment needed for the activity</b></p><p></p><p>Scouts must show that they&#x2019;ve developed their skill and expertise in a particular activity. This will hopefully be something that they have tried and discovered that they enjoy, so have gone on to do more. This could be done outside of Scouting (for example by joining a local club) but it could also be done through Scouting (for example by developing kayaking skills by doing that activity on a number of camps, or developing hiking skills to be able to enter a County competition).<br><br>Keeping a record of when the activity has been done is not important, but you should be able to see that they have improved since their initial try of the activity, and can explain and use safety equipment. You can check their knowledge of safety by observing and asking questions whilst on the activity with the Scouts, or asking them to explain safety aspects separately. They could take this further and complete it in a creative way, for example taking photos or do a presentation to other Scouts.<br><b><br></b></p><p><b>Understand environmental issues surrounding the activity and take steps to reduce any adverse environmental impact</b></p><p>Environmental impacts will be specific to the activity. For example, it could be about minimising erosion to a rock face, keeping to the footpath on a walk through a sensitive area, or riding bikes on recognised trails. You can search for environmental impact assessments online and use them as the basis for running an activity.<br><br></p><p><b>Research further opportunities to take part in or develop your skills in your chosen activities. Follow up your research with action!</b></p><p>Scouts should know how to go on and take part in their chosen activity outside of Scouting to complete this requirement. They don&#x2019;t have to act on this research, but if they have enjoyed the activity you may want to encourage them to go further. If there is an activity or staged activity badge for the activity, they could work towards the Activity Plus badge or Instructor badge. They could also gain a personal or leadership permit in Scouting, or access this activity outside of Scouting, for example, a specialist club. County/Area activity assessors and activity advisors will be a great source of advice. <br></p><br><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

You can see a table showing the differences between the options <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Scouts/Exploration%20or%20expedition%20table.pdf\">here</a>. </div><br>An expedition is a journey with a purpose. The expedition should involve travelling for at least four hours on each day, by foot, cycle, canoe, horse or other agreed means. For more information on using all these forms of transport in Scouting, check out our rules and guidance at <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/a-z\">scouts.org.uk/a-z</a>. <br><br>An exploration is a purpose with a journey. The exploration should involve travelling for at least ninety minutes to reach the destination, by foot, cycle, public transport or other agreed means. Scouts could explore somewhere in the UK or abroad. Having reached the&#xA0;destination, at least five hours of investigation should be carried out over the two days, following up on previously undertaking research. <br><br>For either option, Scouts must have appropriate adult supervision bearing in mind their age, experience, the terrain and activity. As a minimum, such supervision should involve a visual check at the beginning and end of the day, and an adult being available in the local area. It would not usually be an appropriate challenge for the Scouts to be accompanied at all times by an adult.<br><br><div>The level of supervision should be considered as part of the risk assessment and Scouts should have a clear plan for if things go wrong, including knowing how to contact one of the leadership team and emergency services if necessary. Why not plan an incident hike into your programme, to help Scouts prepare for challenges they might experience. Read some tips and ideas <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Go%20on%20an%20incident%20hike.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <br></div><br>You should ensure that you follow the rules and guidance for running Nights Away experiences, such as relevant activity permits and nights away permits, InTouch, parental permission and first aid arrangements. Guidance can be found at <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/nightsaway\">scouts.org.uk/nightsaway</a>, and within the <a href=\"http://shop.scouts.org.uk/p-3627-nights-away.aspx\">Nights Away publication</a>. <br><br>If appropriate, Scouts can stay by themselves overnight, if an Event Passport is issued to the whole group or a named young person. Further information can be found in chapter 9 of <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/por\">POR</a>.The Nights Away permit holder must provide support during both the preparation and the event itself and be satisfied that the young person has the required abilities. <br><br> If Scouts are completing their expedition or expedition abroad, refer to the guidance on the <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4512/going-abroad-with-scouting?cat=52&amp;moduleID=10\">visits abroad page</a>. <br><br>For information, guidance and resources on the following topics, check the links below:<strong><br clear=\"all\"></strong><p></p><div><p><strong><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4736\">Getting started</a> </strong> <br><strong><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4735\">Navigation</a> </strong><br><strong><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4737\">Nights Away</a></strong><br><strong><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4738\">Equipment</a></strong><br><strong><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4739\">Catering</a></strong><strong><br clear=\"all\"></strong> </p></div><div><p>Scouts who have particularly enjoyed this Challenge Award may like to try these Activity Badges: <br clear=\"all\"></p></div><div><ul><li> Air and Sea Navigation</li><li> Cyclist</li><li> Geocaching</li><li> Hill Walker</li><li> Orienteer</li></ul><p><br></p><ul></ul></div><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

The emphasis is on the young person having ownership of the award. One of the challenges should be primarily the Scout&#x2019;s choice, and one the leader&#x2019;s choice. In some cases, it may be helpful to discuss them with the Scout&#x2019;s parents or carers, with the Scout&#x2019;s permission.<br><br><div>Challenges should be individual and require some kind of personal commitment. It could be something to help the Scout develop their confidence, organisational skills, health and fitness, behaviour, communication or skills. For example, a shy Scout&#x2019;s challenge could be supporting a new Scout to complete their Membership Award, or to talk about a topic in front of the rest of their Patrol; or a forgetful Scout&#x2019;s challenge could be to remember to bring the right equipment for activities every week for a term.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Example challenges are provided, but any suitable challenge can be used. Scouts should agree on their two challenges before they start working on them, and it is recommended that the Personal Challenge Award should be completed when a Scout has been in the section for some time, so that you have got to know each other and had time to think about what will be most meaningful. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Some extra examples are provided below:</div><ul><li>Cycle to school for a fortnight</li><li>Help someone with their reading or writing for a term</li><li>Cook one of the evening meals you cooked at camp for your family at home </li><li>Learn how to make your own clothing</li><li>Take your dog for a walk every day for two weeks</li><li>Help to plan and take part in an Investiture Ceremony </li><li>Learn how to light a fire without using matches or a lighter</li><li>Plan and run a Scout&#x2019;s Own </li><li>Grow your own vegetables and use them in cooking</li><li>Make something to sell to raise money for charity</li><li>Do some gardening or other jobs to help an elderly or disabled person</li><li>Create and run a new game for your Troop</li></ul><div><br></div><div>2nd Southampton Scout Troop have put together a great programme to help deliver this Challenge Award which can be found <a href=\"http://www.2ndsouthampton.org.uk/scouts/resources-for-scout-leaders/personal-challenges/\">here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>For more tips and ideas, read a Scouting magazine article about the Personal Challenge Awards <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/documents/Getting personal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </div><p>Thank you to UK Programme Support Team members Linda Thelwell and Trevor Poulson, as well as Andrew Sutherland (Volunteer Head of Programme Support) and Will Reynalds (UK Scout Adviser) for contributing to the example challenges.<br><br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

Any activity where the Scout will develop their fitness level whilst being able to show improvement is acceptable, and activities can be done as a whole Troop or as individuals. A simple chart can be used for record keeping. Scouts should understand the importance of warm up exercises and warm down and record the use of these in their log.<br><br><b>Demonstrate that you understand the importance of a sensible and appropriate diet, and the need for sufficient sleep</b><br>Scouts should be encouraged to understand the importance of diet in maintaining a healthy body, including the importance of a balanced diet as well as staying hydrated and the importance of a regular sleep pattern.

Further guidance and tips can be found below. <br><br>The resource &#x2018;<a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/media/713302/Taking-the-lead-YOUTH-SHAPED-SCOUTING-IN-PRACTICE-040316.pdf\">Taking the Lead</a>&#x2019; provides a wide range of activities which support these badge requirements. It is designed to help you develop leadership skills with Scouts in your Troop, and increase their participation in decision-making processes in Scouting. Most importantly, it will help young people become better team players and leaders, both within Scouting and in preparation for their adult roles in society. <br><br>Young people who have difficulties with communicating or working with others, may need extra support or flexibility to achieve this award. This includes many young people on the autism spectrum.For example, young people may find it more difficult to express themselves, understand others&#x2019; feelings or needs, or understand the concepts involved (eg what it means to be a good leader). <br><br>Scouting provides a great opportunity for young people to learn and develop, in ways they may not necessarily do elsewhere. The leader can be a great role model and source of information, in helping young people to develop their skills in working with others. <br><br>This Challenge Award is a great way to focus on the individual young person and how Scouting can benefit them, and contribute to their personal development. It can build on and apply any learning the young person is doing at school or home, in a supportive and fun environment. <br><br>Below and under each requirement , are some practical tips to help you support all young people to achieve this award. For a young person who has autism or another additional need affecting their communication or social skills, it may also be useful to speak to the parent/carer about any specific work being done at school or home.<br><br><ul><li>Adjust the size of the team or group to the young person&#x2019;s needs. This could include working in a pair or a group of three.</li><li>Time periods and quantities can also be adjusted if necessary.</li><li>The Leader can be used as an important role model to demonstrate how to be an effective leader. </li></ul><h4>Successfully lead a Scout team at a camp or all day event. You need to:</h4><ul><li><b>look after the whole Patrol / team,</b></li><li><b>help individuals in your team if they need it,</b></li><li><b>make sure that your team achieves the goal you have been set.</b></li></ul>A Scout doesn&#x2019;t have to be a Patrol Leader to meet this requirement- members of the Patrol could take it in turns to lead their team, for example during a treasure hunt or while completing an activity.They could also lead their tent group in setting up camp or keeping an area organised, or take charge of their team during a competition. <br><br>Some young people and particularly those on the autism spectrum, may feel anxious/stressed in a new environment, so, leading a familiar task/activity or something they enjoy, would probably be best.<br><br>Young people might need specific examples of how they can be a good leader. Having the goals clearly explained and recorded will be helpful.<br><br>Where a young person has social or communication difficulties, other Scouts in the Troop may need guidance in how best to communicate with the young person, to ask for help or clarification. <br>&#xA0;<br>Remember, depending on the young person&apos;s abilities, the team could just involve one or two other Scouts. <br><br><h4>Help a new Scout to be part of the Troop with an understanding of what is expected of them.</h4>If you have a number of Scouts working on this requirement, then two or three Scouts could work together to look after the new young person, or they could each take responsibility for different things.<br><br>Young people may need specific tasks or ideas, of how to help the new Scout.For example, showing or reading the Troop&#x2019;s Code of Conduct or the Promises, leading an investiture, showing the young person around the meeting place, or showing the young person the their uniform and badges.<br><br><h4>Help another Scout to develop a Scouting skill.&#xA0;</h4>To complete this requirement, Scouts should teach a new skill to another member of their Troop. This could be a Scouting skill, such as tracking or how to tie a knot, or one of their personal hobbies or interests.<br><br>Young people may need ideas of how to teach another young person a skill. Adult volunteer&#x2019;s will be a good role models for this. This could be through a range of methods, including speaking writing, demonstration, drawing or photos.&#xA0;<br><br><b><br>Represent the views of other Scouts (for example at a Patrol Leaders&#x2019; Council or something similar) and report back to them afterwards.</b><br><br>Representing their peers is an important skill for Scouts to learn, not just for Patrol Leaders but for all members of the Troop. The activities suggested could all be used to help the Scouts completing the award find out what the rest of the Scouts want to do, whether this is ideas for games and activities to do at weekly meetings, or ideas for their future camp or residential experience.<br><br>If the young person has difficulties with speaking/listening, this could involve a questionnaire, or collecting written feedback from the other Scouts. <br><br>You should then make sure that there are opportunities for the Scouts to feed the information they gather back to the leadership team, for example at a Patrol Leader&apos;s forum. For more information about Scout Troop forums, click here. <br><br>Information on Troop Forums can be found <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4095/scout-troop-forums?moduleID=10&amp;cat=708\">here</a>.

Teams in Scouts could be their Patrol, games team, residential groups or activity grouping. Remember, Scouting should be youth shaped, so involve young people in planning activities in the Programme.<br></p><p>Remember to think about how you give the instructions or rules for the activity, to ensure the understanding of all young people. For more information related to autism, click <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4468/principle-and-strategies-autism?cat=377,786&amp;moduleID=10\">here</a>. <br></p><p>For young people who find working with others more difficult, this could involve developing participation in games or activities that they are already familiar with or already being used in the Section. To encourage young people to start working together, an activity could be used that can only be completed by each member of the team joining in, and could not be completed independently.<br></p><h4><b>Give at least three examples of when you&#x2019;ve been in different types of teams. Explain your role in those teams.</b></h4><p>There are many different types of teams that Scouts will participate in, for example Patrols, games teams, sports teams, activity groups and residential experience groups. To fulfil this requirement, Scouts should give examples of two different types of team and roles in those teams. They may be teams the Scout knows about, or has been part of.&#xA0;</p><p>Some young people may have difficulty expressing themselves verbally or remembering this information. Consider others ways they could communicate this information &#x2013; for example, using photographs of them participating in teams, young people could explain either in words or writing, what they were doing. <br></p><h4>Take part in at least three teambuilding activities that you have not tried before.</h4><p>Teambuilding activities are an integral part of the Scout programme and there should be plenty of opportunities in the programme for Scouts to complete this requirement. Good examples can be found in Programmes Online.<br></p><p>Some young people may need a specific example or role that they can take on. For example, keeping time during an activity or encouraging others by saying &#x2018;well done&#x2019; etc.These could be displayed visually, to be used as prompts, or for young people to choose a role in the team. <br></p><h4>Take an active part in at least four Troop or Patrol Forums. At each forum, express your views on at least one item being discussed.</h4><p>A Pack Forum is an opportunity for Scouts to &#x2018;have their say&#x2019;. Very often an informal discussion with the Troop, Patrol or just the Patrol Leaders, it could be deciding on a programme activity or where to go on an outing.<br>More information on Troop Forums and how to run them can be found <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4095/scout-troop-forums?moduleID=10&amp;cat=708\">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

Scouts could brainstorm topics, issues and services in their community, then vote to work out what is most important to them as a group. They could visit a local community service to gather the experiences and views of different people - this might be the service providers and those that use the service. Or, they could arrange for a local councillor or other community figure to visit the section meeting. <br></p><p>Patrols could make short videos of what they&#x2019;ve discovered, or put something together to share with local councillors or community leaders. They could each identify one reason why the topic, issue or service is important to themselves and one reason why it&#x2019;s important to someone else. <br></p><p>Goal 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities) of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainable Development Goals</a> may provide some inspiration for issues to explore. For example, access to broadband or phone signal in rural areas, affordable housing, or flooding. <br></p><p>Scouts who particularly enjoyed this part of the award, depending on what topic they explored, may like to work towards their Local Knowledge Activity Badge, Farming Activity Badge, Global Issues Activity Badge, or World Faiths Activity Badge.<br></p><p></p><h4><b>Spend a day volunteering with and finding out about a service in your local community&#xA0;</b> </h4><p>Make sure that Scouts are engaged in choosing what kind of service they would like to volunteer with. They could consider what skills they already have that they can contribute, or what skills they can gain from volunteering. <br>The service could be what Scouts have researched for requirement one. It can be anything that supports the local community, for example a food bank, local nature reserve, homeless shelter, care home, day centre, community cafes, city farm, or clubs for the elderly. Opportunities may be available through <a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">A Million Hands</a>, for example, Scouts can connect with their local dementia service through the partnership with the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Society.<br><br>Scouts who particularly enjoyed this part of the award may like to work towards their Global Issues Activity Badge, Local Knowledge Activity Badge, or Community Impact Staged Activity Badge, to make a bigger difference in their local, national or international community. <br></p><h4><b>Take part in an activity that reflects upon and explores your own beliefs, attitudes and values </b></h4><p>This requirement is about the young person&apos;s own beliefs, attitudes and values, rather than learning about other people&#x2019;s. Remember that Scouting is inclusive of young people and adults of all faiths, humanists, atheists and those without an affirmed faith. It is important that all young people feel included and valued in Scouting and that their beliefs are respected.<br><br>Reflective activities may feel like quite a change from typical activities in the section, but it is important to spend time thinking about what it means to be a Scout and to live by our Promise. Useful activities to support this can be found in the Rise to the Challenge, which can be downloaded <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/2926/spiritual-development-resources?cat=25&amp;moduleID=10\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br><br>The World Membership Badge could be a useful way to open discussion about the values of Scouting.The badge represents being part of the world family of Scouting, and all members worldwide will commit to a Scout Promise and Law. The wording of these will vary between different National Scout Organisations, but will all be based on the original, as used by Baden Powell.&#xA0;<br></p><p>In the UK, we have the Fundamentals which capture the core essence of Scouting and underpin everything that we do. These include the Values, which are belief, co-operation, care, respect and integrity. There is a short animation exploring the Fundamentals available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIrREHlgo18\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. This may be useful in starting your discussions.Discuss the values with the section: what do they mean to us as individuals and how can we apply them in everyday life?</p><p>Scouts who particularly enjoyed this part of the award might like to learn about other beliefs, as in their World Faiths Activity Badge.<br></p><p></p><h4><b>Take part in an activity that explores common beliefs and attitudes towards gender or disability in different societies. </b></h4><p>For this requirement, Scouts could vote (as a section or patrol) whether they want to look at gender or disability. Then, they could identify another country or another area in the UK, and compare similarities and differences in beliefs and attitudes.</p><p>For the topic of gender, Scouts could look at things like gender stereotypes, ability to vote, access to education, access to Scouting, employment, or pay inequality. If they&#x2019;re can&#x2019;t decide on a society to compare, they could look at the home country of a celebrity that has moved to the UK, or use a country where they have existing contacts in Scouting.Here are some links that may be useful:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://sdg-tracker.org/gender-equality\" target=\"_blank\">data on gender equality around the world</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/whats-life-like-for-a-female-easyjet-pilot\" target=\"_blank\">article on gender and the career of airline pilot </a><br></li></ul><p>For the topic of disability, if Scouts need somewhere to start, there are some good activities in the <a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/resource\" target=\"_blank\">A Million Hands resources</a> to introduce the topic. <br></p><p>Scouts could look at how the life experiences of Paralympic athletes from different countries may have differed, or look at access to sport in the UK. They could link up with a local organisation or group supporting individuals with disabilities to access sport, like <a href=\"https://climbingforallsheffield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this climbing charity</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bikeworks.org.uk/all-ability/\" target=\"_blank\">these cycling clubs</a>. <br></p><p>Scouts could look at how individuals with disabilities are represented in the fashion industry.

You could link with a local environmental organisation to complete this. It could be something that is completed in one meeting/day or a longer term project. <br><br>Contact your local council, <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/find-wildlife-trust\" target=\"_blank\">local Wildlife Trust</a> or other local environmental organisation to find out if there are any existing or new environmental projects that Scouts could get involved in. For example, some councils will have schemes where community groups can adopt a park or another outdoor space. <br></p><p>Here are some ideas for projects:<br></p><ul><li>Adopt a section of their local canal or river, with the Canal &amp; River Trust.

You could learn about:</li><ul><li>&#x2022;local government</li><li>&#x2022;local history</li><li>&#x2022;different faiths and beliefs</li><li>&#x2022;types of farming found locally</li></ul><li>Work with people or an organisation from a community. Take the chance to find an issue that your Troop could help with. It should be something that helps people and also helps you grow as a person. Plan and carry out the project with your Troop and others in the community. Then share what you learned from the activity with other people. Talk about how it helped other people and what you will do with the skills and experiences you have gained.</li><li>Plan, take an active part in and evaluate a local community service. Doing the service should take you at least six hours (not including planning and evaluating).</li><li>Take part in an activity which reflects upon and explores your own beliefs, attitudes and values (this may or may not include religious beliefs).</li><li>Take part in an activity that explores different beliefs and attitudes. You could look at fashion, music, sport or disability.</li><li>Give several examples of how you have kept your Scout Promise and Scout Laws.</li><li>Take an active part in an environmental project.</li><li>Investigate and try to make contact with Scouts in another country.</li><li>Take part in an activity that explores an international issue.<br></li></ol><p><br><b>Flexibility</b><br><br>Each young person who participates in the Programme, including badges and awards, should face a similar degree of challenge, and requirements can be adapted according to each young person&#x2019;s abilities.For more information and practical tips see our guidance on <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/1301/policy-and-approach?cat=377,293&amp;moduleID=10\">flexibility</a></p><h3>Guidance for Leaders:</h3><p>Scouts who have particularly enjoyed this Challenge Award may like to try these Activity Badges:<br></p><ul><li>Astronautics</li><li>Astronomer</li><li>Communicator</li><li>Environmental Conservation</li><li>Fire Safety</li><li>Forester</li><li>Fundraising</li><li>International</li><li>Lifesaver</li><li>Local Knowledge</li><li>My Faith</li><li>Naturalist</li><li>Smallholder</li><li>World Faiths</li><li>World Issues</li></ul><p><br>For some inspiration, read the blog on the World Challenge Awards <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/news/2016/06/badge-support-world-challenge-awards/\">here</a>.</p><p>As well as the additional guidance below, Programmes Online contains lots of activity ideas that you could use to deliver this badge.<br><br><b>Identify an aspect of local community life and find out what you can about it</b><br>When finding out about the local community the project should include some fact finding, a visit to or from the project and some sort of report back. You could be creative in the way that you do this, for example: theme a couple of evenings around a local visit including some follow-up activities; invite someone in to run an evening based around a community theme; get Patrols to make short videos or sketches about what they have learned; or complete a community action project (see below) which links to the community theme learned about for this requirement.<br><br><b>What issues affect you? Find out who you could talk to who can make a difference</b><br>Scouts should be encouraged to think about issues which affect them within their local community, and which they may have an opportunity to influence. One way of completing this could be to invite a local councillor or other community figure in. Most towns and counties now have youth councils who express young people&#x2019;s views to local decision making bodies.<br><br>Remember that not every young person will be interested in campaigning to make a difference on an issue. Provided they know who they could talk to if they wanted to, they do not have to raise the issue to meet this requirement.<br><br><b>Plan, take an active part in, and evaluate, a local community service</b><br>Make sure that Scouts are engaged in choosing what kind of community service they would like to do, and planning to do it. Activities within the Youth Involvement Toolkit can help you to engage Scouts with this element.<br><br>The time may be spent doing a number of different projects or by showing commitment to a single project over a longer period of time. Examples of community service could be running a fund-raising stall or game, delivering leaflets, gardening, helping with activities for younger children. Where possible the community service should link in with the local community life project.<br><br><b>Take part in an activity that demonstrates your understanding of your own faith or beliefs</b><br>Scouting is inclusive of young people and adults of all faiths, humanists, atheists and those without an affirmed faith. It is important that all young people feel included and valued in Scouting and that their beliefs are respected. This requirement is about the young person&apos;s own faith or beliefs, rather than learning about other people&#x2019;s. An activity may include creating a space for young people to reflect on their personal beliefs, values and attitudes; or reflecting on what they need to feel happy and secure; or taking time to reflect and say thank you. <br><br><b>Take part in an activity that explores different beliefs and attitudes</b><br>When getting a Scout to explore how others may have different attitudes to their own any topic can be used. The topics can be as diverse as local cultures, different types of music, football teams, political parties, fashion etc.<br></p><p>The values of Scouting are belief, co-operation, care, respect and integrity. <br>Explore the values of Scouting with the Section, what do they mean and how can we apply them in everyday life? There is a short animation exploring the Fundamentals- the purpose, values and method of Scouting available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIrREHlgo18\">here</a>. This may be useful in starting your discussions. <br><br><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/DocumentUpload/October2014/Rise%20to%20the%20Challenge%20booklet%20May2014.pdf\">Rise to the Challenge</a> is a programme resource to support young peopleto explore their beliefs, attitudes and values via activities. This resource can be used to support young people to understand and appreciate difference and become more tolerant of opinions and beliefs which may be different than their own. Rise to the Challenge explores beliefs, attitudes and values rather than specific faiths or religions.<br><br>The &#x2018;major world faiths&#x2019; are widely accepted to include Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Sikhism. However, this is not an exhaustive list and a broader list of more religions can be found via <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/\">BBC Religion pages</a>, which also includes numerically smaller groups, such as Shinto and Taoism.<br><br>A useful interactive resource to support young people to explore world faiths is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/z7hs34j\">BBC Bitesize</a>, there are wealth of videos and animations which explore specific elements of different religions eg. What is it like to go Hajj, or what happens at Passover specifically aimed at young people. <br><br>There is also the <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/faith/232_AS%20Faith%20walk%20v2.pdf\">Faith Walk resource</a>, which takes young people around the faith buildings at Gilwell Park and explains their significance. <br><br><b>Give several examples of how you have kept your Scout Promise and Scout Laws</b><br>When asking Scouts to give examples of how they have kept their Scout Promise and Scout Laws, ask them how they think they have done their best, and how they have kept different elements. This doesn&#x2019;t need to be an in depth analysis of every element of the Promise and Law &#x2013; a few different examples are fine. You could use activities that explore the meaning of the Promise to complete this requirement, Scouts could explain their understanding to new members in preparation for investitures, they could keep a diary or photo diary, or could do a speed dating style event where they have three minutes to tell someone else how they have kept their Promise and Laws.<br><br><b>Take an active part in an environmental project</b><br>This project should be something that helps the environment, and could be based around the Scout meeting place or activity centre, in the community, or a private area. You could link with a local environmental organisation to complete this.<br><br>This environmental project could be linked to your community action project for requirement 3, but does not have to be.<br><br><b>Investigate and try to make contact with Scouts in another Country</b><br>Making contact with Scouts in another country can be done a number of ways, for example through Nights Away in the UK or overseas, the internet, pen pals, Jamboree-on-the-Air (JOTA), Jamboree-on-the-Internet (JOTI), programmes run by WOSM, or linking with groups that are part of British Scouting Overseas or Branches of The Scout Association.<br><br><b>Take part in an activity that explores an international issue</b><br>Examples of international issues which could be explored include: trade, health, water and sanitation, environment, conflict, refugees, peace, tourism, homelessness, poverty, animal welfare or conservation. Scouts should be able to show an understanding of the issues involved, how the issues affect the UK and other countries, and be able to take some relevant action.</p><h4>Further support</h4>One topic that Scouts could explore as part of their Award is refugees. The Refugee Response Resource provides information, guidance and activities to help Leaders explore the topic of refugees with their section, developing their understanding and supporting them to plan action.

It benefits the wider community as well as the young people taking part. Encourage Scouts to go for this badge and help them consider these questions:<br></p><ol><li>Do you want to take action on issues affecting people in your local area, across the country or all across the world?</li><li>Is the action you want to take relevant to the community you&#x2019;re trying to help? Or is it trying to fix a problem that doesn&#x2019;t exist?</li><li>Will it genuinely change the lives of others, or is it just a nice thing to do?</li><li>Will the action you want to take genuinely develop you as a person? Or is it actually quite boring, mundane and not very much fun?</li></ol><p><br><b>Identifying need</b><br><br>Social issues can affect different people in different ways. Young people will face different problems from older people. Those living in the countryside will have different challenges from those who live in a city centre. Social issues in Scotland are very different from those in Tibet. This requirementis about knowing what issues are relevant to the people you are trying to help. Young people should ask themselves:<br></p><ol><li>Who in our chosen community will be an expert in the issues and challenges people face or are passionate about?</li><li>Are there other sources of research or information we can use to identify issues?</li><li>What issues do we care about?</li></ol><p><br><b>Planning action</b><br><br>Community impact is about creating positive social change, so Scouts must be clear on what exactly they want to change before deciding on what practical action to take. You should help young people to ask themselves, in this order:<br></p><ol><li>What is the problem they are trying to fix?</li><li>What needs to change to fix that problem?</li><li>What can we actually do to make that change?</li></ol><p><br><b>Learning and continuing to make change</b><br>&#xA0;<br>Community impact should develop the young person taking part, so your projects should have some kind of learning outcome. Young people should be given space to reflect and talk about what they have learned.<br></p><ol><li>What have they learned about the issue they took action on?</li><li>What skills have they learned?</li><li>How have their values and attitudes developed? </li></ol><p><br>The project should also contribute to social change, and that is unlikely to happen in a short space of time. So once they reach a stage where they consider their project finished, you should support young people to think further.<br></p><ol><li>How could they improve their Community Impact project so that it reaches more people and makes a bigger impact?</li><li>How could they involve more people in their project?</li><li>Would they consider participating in a community impact project run by another organisation or group on the same or different issues?</li></ol><p><br><b>Celebrating the work and inspiring others</b><br><br>Social change happens when others are inspired to take action. You should support young people to reach and inspire more people who can take action on their chosen issue. You could do this through:<br></p><ul><li>interacting with local media</li><li>presenting to relevant groups of people such as local business, decision makers and other community groups</li><li>interacting with other non-Scouting youth groups, such as schools, youth clubs and sports teams</li><li>speaking to their own families, other Scout groups and sections.</li></ul><p></p>Click <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/CI%20Activities%20list.pdf\">here</a> for some ideas to help you achieve this badge.<h4><br></h4><h4>Further support<br></h4><div>Find activities, resources and support to enable young people to take action on the topics of disability; mental wellbeing and resilience; dementia; or clean water and sanitation, at <a href=\"https://www.scouts.org.uk/community\" target=\"_blank\">scouts.org.uk/community</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Read this article from Scouting Magazine on <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/documents/How to plan a community impact project.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">how to run a community impact project</a>.<br></div><div><br></div></div><div>Here are some activities from Scouting Magazine, which you can use to explore particular issues with young people:<br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017%20-%20brain%20connections.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Brain connections</a> (dementia)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-2%20-%20getting%20from%20A%20to%20B.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Getting from A to B</a> (sight loss)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-3%20-%20stressball.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stress ball</a> (mental health)</li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-4%20-%20tinfoil%20still.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tinfoil still</a> (access to clean water)<br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Take a look at these examples of how local Groups have taken part in A Million Hands. <br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/january-project-month\" target=\"_blank\">81st Belfast Beavers -creating memory books</a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2018/07/memory-lane/\">6th East Kilbride Beavers - creating memory boxes</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/project-month-november\" target=\"_blank\">1st Staindrop Cubs - taking action around visual impairment<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-5th-douglas-scouts-hike-for-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">5th Douglas Scouts - completing a water hike<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-1st-knighton-scouts-learn-new-sign-language-for-their-a-million-hands-project/\" target=\"_blank\">1st Knighton Scouts - learning Makaton<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-celebrate-guide-dogs-week-with-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">37th Ormskirk (St Annes) Scout Group - learning about sight loss</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>The Refugee Response Resource provides information, guidance and activities to help Leaders explore the topic of refugees with their section, developing their understanding and supporting them to plan action.Download the resource <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=52,207\">here</a>.</div><br><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

Although the requirements for Stage 1 can completed without actually being on the water, it&#x2019;s best to complete them as part of a sailing activity. As well as being more fun, this will give young people a head start when they start working towards Stage 2.<br><br>For centres that run sailing, we have a useful list of <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545,553\">water facilities and training centres</a> to refer to. Some <a href=\"https://www.scoutadventures.org.uk/\">Scout Adventures</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scouts-scotland.org.uk/activity-centres.aspx\">Scout Scotland National Activity Centres</a> also run this activity.<br></p><p>If running this activity yourself on <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/factsheets/FS120623.pdf\">class C waters</a>, you don&#x2019;t need a permit for sailing, just someone who has the appropriate skills and knowledge to lead the activity, and to complete a risk assessment.Class C waters are &#x2018;safe inland waters which are less than 100m wide where flow causes little effect (including swimming pools)&#x2019;. If on other waters, you can find a local permit holder for this activity, via a permit holder search on Compass (for guidance click <a href=\"https://compasssupport.scouts.org.uk/?guide-cat=permits\">here</a>) or by contacting your local Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme.Take a look at this <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545\">directory</a> which shows classifications of waterways in UK. <br></p><p>If you have a local <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=7,306,308\">Sea Scout</a> Group or Unit , why not see if you can join in with some of their activities, or even arrange a time for their permit holder(s) to take your section out on the water.&#xA0;<br></p><p>By the time young people reach Stage 4, taking part in a sail training experience may be really beneficial in working towards some of the elements of the badge. There are some great opportunities for Explorers to really challenge themselves that are offered by organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.dsp.uk.com/\">Discovery Sailing Project</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adventuresoffshore.co.uk/\">Adventures Offshore</a> are perfect for Explorers to get involved with. <b><br></b></p><p><br><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

For example, if you have completed the expedition element of your Chief Scout&#x2019;s Diamond Award but not the rest of the award, you can begin the expedition section of the Queen&#x2019;s Scout Award as long as you are over the age of 16 and have registered for the Queen&#x2019;s Scout Award.</p><p>CHALLENGES - TIME COMMITMENT<br>The minimum time requirements for each section are expressed in months, during which you need to undertake a regular commitment averaging at least an hour a week.</p><p>TAKING A BREAK OR CHANGING ACTIVITIES<br>If you want to change activities during an award, this is possible, although on one occasion only. It is also possible to take a break from an activity and then to restart from where you stopped. This could happen during a period of school, college or university exams.</p><p>CREST AWARDS &#xA0;Young people could complete a Gold CREST project for their skill challenge. For more information about CREST Awards, click <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/crestawards\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <br></p><p>MAKING THE AWARD ACCESSIBLE<br>EachyoungpersonwhoparticipatesintheProgramme,includingbadgesandawards,shouldfaceasimilardegreeof challenge, and requirements can be adapted according to each young person&#x2019;s abilities.</p><p>The Queen&#x2019;s Scout Award is based on personal best effort rather than fixed standards, and should be available to all members of Explorer Scouts and the Scout Network. This may mean that for some individuals, the requirements of the award need to be adapted to ensure that they face the same degree of challenge as other participants.</p><p>Where additional needs have to be taken into account, it is acceptable to adjust some of the activities to make them more accessible. You should work with your mentor to discuss any adaptations, and make sure that any adaptations have been approved by the commissioner who will sign off your award. As every set of individual circumstances will be different, it is left to the discretion of the relevant commissioner to make any adaptations to the activities, including the expedition requirement.</p><p>For more information on how to include someone with additional needs in Scouting, visit <a href=\"http://www.scouts.org.uk/diversity\">scouts.org.uk/diversity</a>.You can also email<br><a href=\"mailto:programme@scouts.org.uk\">programme@scouts.org.uk</a> with specific queries.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>THE QUEEN&#x2019;S SCOUT WORKING PARTY (QSWP)</h3>The QSWP is a national Scout Active Support Unit and membership only open to those who have gained their Queen&apos;s Scout Award.

It benefits the wider community as well as the young people taking part. Encourage Scouts to go for this badge and help them consider these questions:<br></p><ol><li>Do you want to take action on issues affecting people in your local area, across the country or all across the world?</li><li>Is the action you want to take relevant to the community you&#x2019;re trying to help? Or is it trying to fix a problem that doesn&#x2019;t exist?</li><li>Will it genuinely change the lives of others, or is it just a nice thing to do?</li><li>Will the action you want to take genuinely develop you as a person? Or is it actually quite boring, mundane and not very much fun?</li></ol><p><br><b>Identifying need</b><br><br>Social issues can affect different people in different ways. Young people will face different problems from older people. Those living in the countryside will have different challenges from those who live in a city centre. Social issues in Scotland are very different from those in Tibet. This requirementis about knowing what issues are relevant to the people you are trying to help. Young people should ask themselves:<br></p><ol><li>Who in our chosen community will be an expert in the issues and challenges people face or are passionate about?</li><li>Are there other sources of research or information we can use to identify issues?</li><li>What issues do we care about?</li></ol><p><br><b>Planning action</b><br><br>Community impact is about creating positive social change, so Scouts must be clear on what exactly they want to change before deciding on what practical action to take. You should help young people to ask themselves, in this order:<br></p><ol><li>What is the problem they are trying to fix?</li><li>What needs to change to fix that problem?</li><li>What can we actually do to make that change?</li></ol><p><br><b>Learning and continuing to make change</b><br>&#xA0;<br>Community impact should develop the young person taking part, so your projects should have some kind of learning outcome. Young people should be given space to reflect and talk about what they have learned.<br></p><ol><li>What have they learned about the issue they took action on?</li><li>What skills have they learned?</li><li>How have their values and attitudes developed? </li></ol><p><br>The project should also contribute to social change, and that is unlikely to happen in a short space of time. So once they reach a stage where they consider their project finished, you should support young people to think further.<br></p><ol><li>How could they improve their Community Impact project so that it reaches more people and makes a bigger impact?</li><li>How could they involve more people in their project?</li><li>Would they consider participating in a community impact project run by another organisation or group on the same or different issues?</li></ol><p><br><b>Celebrating the work and inspiring others</b><br><br>Social change happens when others are inspired to take action. You should support young people to reach and inspire more people who can take action on their chosen issue. You could do this through:<br></p><ul><li>interacting with local media</li><li>presenting to relevant groups of people such as local business, decision makers and other community groups</li><li>interacting with other non-Scouting youth groups, such as schools, youth clubs and sports teams</li><li>speaking to their own families, other Scout groups and sections.</li></ul><p></p>Click <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/CI%20Activities%20list.pdf\">here</a> for some ideas to help you achieve this badge.<h4><br></h4><h4>Further support<br></h4><div>Find activities, resources and support to enable young people to take action on the topics of disability; mental wellbeing and resilience; dementia; or clean water and sanitation, at <a href=\"https://www.scouts.org.uk/community\" target=\"_blank\">scouts.org.uk/community</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Read this article from Scouting Magazine on <a href=\"https://staging.scouts.org.uk/documents/How to plan a community impact project.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">how to run a community impact project</a>.<br></div><div><br></div></div><div>Here are some activities from Scouting Magazine, which you can use to explore particular issues with young people:<br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017%20-%20brain%20connections.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Brain connections</a> (dementia)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-2%20-%20getting%20from%20A%20to%20B.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Getting from A to B</a> (sight loss)<br></li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-3%20-%20stressball.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stress ball</a> (mental health)</li><li><a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Pages%20from%20ScoutingMagazineAutumn2017-4%20-%20tinfoil%20still.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Tinfoil still</a> (access to clean water)<br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Take a look at these examples of how local Groups have taken part in A Million Hands. <br></div><div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/january-project-month\" target=\"_blank\">81st Belfast Beavers -creating memory books</a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2018/07/memory-lane/\">6th East Kilbride Beavers - creating memory boxes</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amillionhands.org.uk/project-month-november\" target=\"_blank\">1st Staindrop Cubs - taking action around visual impairment<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-5th-douglas-scouts-hike-for-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">5th Douglas Scouts - completing a water hike<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-1st-knighton-scouts-learn-new-sign-language-for-their-a-million-hands-project/\" target=\"_blank\">1st Knighton Scouts - learning Makaton<br></a></li><li><a href=\"https://scouts.org.uk/news/2017/10/blog-celebrate-guide-dogs-week-with-a-million-hands/\" target=\"_blank\">37th Ormskirk (St Annes) Scout Group - learning about sight loss</a><br></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>The Refugee Response Resource provides information, guidance and activities to help Leaders explore the topic of refugees with their section, developing their understanding and supporting them to plan action.Download the resource <a href=\"https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=52,207\">here</a>.</div><br><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "

If on other waters, you can find a local permit holder for this activity, via a permit holder search on Compass (for guidance click <a href=\"https://compasssupport.scouts.org.uk/?guide-cat=permits\">here</a>) or by contacting your local Manager of the Activity Permit Scheme.Take a look at this <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=26,545\">directory</a> which shows classifications of waterways in UK. <br></p><p>If you have a local <a href=\"http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/search/?cat=7,306,308\">Sea Scout</a> Group or Unit , why not see if you can join in with some of their activities, or even arrange a time for their permit holder(s) to take your section out on the water.&#xA0;<br></p><p>By the time young people reach Stage 4, taking part in a sail training experience may be really beneficial in working towards some of the elements of the badge. There are some great opportunities for Explorers to really challenge themselves that are offered by organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.dsp.uk.com/\">Discovery Sailing Project</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adventuresoffshore.co.uk/\">Adventures Offshore</a> are perfect for Explorers to get involved with. <b><br></b></p><p><br><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#xA0;</p> "
